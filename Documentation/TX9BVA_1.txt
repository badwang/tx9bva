Module "AD1"       (component ADC)
   - AD1_MeasureChan -This method performs measurement on one channel. (Note: If the <number of conversions> is more than one 
                the conversion of the A/D channel is performed specified number of times.)
   - AD1_GetValue8 -This method returns the last measured values of all channels. Compared with <GetValue> method this method 
                returns more accurate result if the <number of conversions> is greater than 1 and <AD resolution> is less than 
                8 bits. In addition, the user code dependency on <AD resolution> is eliminated.

Module "Backlight" (component BitIO)
   - Backlight_GetVal -Returns the input/output value. If the direction is [input] then the input value of the pin is read and 
                returned. If the direction is [output] then the last written value is returned (see <Safe mode> property for 
                limitations). This method cannot be disabled if direction is [input].
   - Backlight_PutVal -The specified output value is set. If the direction is [input], the component saves the value to a 
                memory or a register and this value will be written to the pin after switching to the output mode (using 
                [SetDir(TRUE)]; see <Safe mode> property for limitations). If the direction is [output], it writes the value to 
                the pin. (Method is available only if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_).
   - Backlight_ClrVal -Clears (set to zero) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(FALSE)]. This method is available 
                only if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.
   - Backlight_SetVal -Sets (to one) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(TRUE)]. This method is available only if 
                the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.

Module "Signal_In" (component BitsIO)
   - Signal_In_GetVal -Returns the value of the Input/Output component. If the direction is [input] then reads the input value 
                of the pins and returns it. If the direction is [output] then returns the last written value (see <Safe mode> 
                property for limitations).
   - Signal_In_GetBit -Returns the value of the specified bit/pin of the Input/Output component. If the direction is [input] 
                then it reads the input value of the pin and returns it. If the direction is [output] then it returns the last 
                written value (see <Safe mode> property for limitations).

Module "Lever_Pos" (component BitsIO)
   - Lever_Pos_GetVal -Returns the value of the Input/Output component. If the direction is [input] then reads the input value 
                of the pins and returns it. If the direction is [output] then returns the last written value (see <Safe mode> 
                property for limitations).
   - Lever_Pos_PutVal -Specified value is passed to the Input/Output component. If the direction is [input] saves the value to 
                a memory or a register, this value will be written to the pins after switching to the output mode - using 
                [SetDir(TRUE)] (see <Safe mode> property for limitations). If the direction is [output] it writes the value to 
                the pins. (Method is available only if the Direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_).

Module "PWM_In"    (component Capture)
   - PWM_In_Reset -This method resets the counter register (see implementation note in <General Info>).
   - PWM_In_GetCaptureValue -This method gets the last value captured by enabled timer (see implementation note in <General 
                Info>). The method does not return valid value after initialization or after <Reset> until new capture event 
                (even if the returned Error code is ERR_OK).
   - PWM_In_GetPinValue -The method reads the Capture pin value. The method is available only if it is possible to read the pin 
                value (usually not available for internal signals).

Module "PWM_Timer" (component TimerInt)

Module "WDT"       (component WatchDog)
   - WDT_Clear -Clears the watchdog timer (it makes the timer restart from zero).

Module "Cpu"       (component MC9S08PA4_16)
   - Cpu_EnableInt -Enables maskable interrupts
   - Cpu_DisableInt -Disables maskable interrupts
